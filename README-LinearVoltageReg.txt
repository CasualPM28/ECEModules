README for Linear Voltage Regulator
@Vincent Agostino Del Tufo, 916328545

Linear Voltage Regulator:

The design taken for the constant linear voltage regulator is that of taking in an unregulated voltage via the input, making sure it is smooth and free of noise (as much as possible)
with bypass capacitors, feeding it into the LF33ABV 3.3V voltage regulator, and then taking the output regulated voltage, smoothing it out again, and outputting it into the main circuit.
The design was done with simplicity in mind so that it could provide the function of regualting voltage without being overly complex and expensive. 

Dataset Used, LF33ABV:

Parts Used:
1uF Capacitor             - x2
0.1uF Capacitor           - x2
LF33ABV Voltage Regulator - x1

How to import design into new DipTrace schematic:

1.) Open the schematic in DipTrace alongside the new circuit.
2.) Copy the entire design with Ctrl+A and Ctrl+C.
3.) Paste the design into the project on a new sheet.
4.) Rename sheet to "Linear 3.3v Voltage Regulator" and turn the sheet into a hierarchical block under "Edit" -> "Sheet Type" -> "Hierarchy Block".
